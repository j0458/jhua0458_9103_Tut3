## How to Interact
The overall dynamics of the work presents the effects of rotation. The specific interactive effects are as follows:

- **Change the image state through different buttons：** When any of the Q, W, E or R keys on the keyboard is pressed, the corresponding image state change will be triggered according to the key, which gives the main visual elements different levels and playability.

- **Main Visual Dynamics (`mouseX`):** The movement of the mouse causes the main visual graphic elements to rotate.

- **Outer circle dynamics (`mouseX`):** When `mouseX` increases, the small circle in the outer circle will shrink towards the center. Conversely, when `mouseX` decreases, the small circle in the outer circle will spread out.

- **Dynamic lines radiating outwards (`mouseX`)(`mouseY`):** When the mouse moves horizontally or vertically, the lines radiating outward will rotate and change accordingly, adding dynamic interest to the picture.

- **Random stars appear in the center:** By clicking the mouse, twinkling stars will appear randomly in the center circle, increasing the overall fun and uncertainty.

## Details of My Individual Approach to Animating the Group Code

## Inspiration
My work is inspired by the following two works:

- **Picture 1:** Compared with the monotony brought by the regular rotation of lines in the plane, the dynamic simulation of light scattering can make the rotation of lines show a stronger sense of space and rhythm. By changing the position of the mouse, changing the length and rotation angle of the line, the overall visual effect breaks the plane limitation of two-dimensional rotation.

- **Picture 2:** Compared with the mechanical and monotonous feeling brought by circular elements rotating in a single direction, multiple circular elements rotating in different directions at the same time can visually create a dynamic sense of order and staggered space. It guides the viewer to feel the fluidity and complexity of time while gazing, as if they are in a concrete "time field". In this way, the interface not only becomes a visual carrier, but also symbolizes the experience of the passage of time.
