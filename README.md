## How to Interact
The overall dynamics of the work presents the effects of rotation. The specific interactive effects are as follows:

- **Change the image state through different buttons：** When any of the Q, W, E or R keys on the keyboard is pressed, the corresponding image state change will be triggered according to the key, which gives the main visual elements different levels and playability.

- **Main Visual Dynamics (`mouseX`):** The movement of the mouse causes the main visual graphic elements to rotate.

- **Outer circle dynamics (`mouseX`):** When `mouseX` increases, the small circle in the outer circle will shrink towards the center. Conversely, when `mouseX` decreases, the small circle in the outer circle will spread out.

- **Dynamic lines radiating outwards (`mouseX`)(`mouseY`):** When the mouse moves horizontally or vertically, the lines radiating outward will rotate and change accordingly, adding dynamic interest to the picture.

- **Random stars appear in the center:** By clicking the mouse, twinkling stars will appear randomly in the center circle, increasing the overall fun and uncertainty.
