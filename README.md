## How to Interact
The overall dynamics of the work presents the effects of rotation and progressive layers. The specific interactive effects are as follows:

- **Change the image state through different buttonsï¼š** When you press any of the Q, W, E or R keys on the keyboard, the corresponding image state changes will be triggered according to the key.

- **Main Visual Dynamics (`mouseX`):** The movement of the mouse causes the main visual graphic elements to rotate.

- **Outer circle dynamics (`mouseX`):** When `mouseX` increases, the small circle in the outer circle will shrink towards the center. Conversely, when `mouseX` decreases, the small circle in the outer circle will spread out.

- ** Dynamic lines radiating outwards (`mouseX`)(`mouseY`):** When the mouse moves horizontally or vertically, the lines radiating outward will change randomly, thereby increasing the dynamic interest of the picture.

- **Random stars appear in the center:** By clicking the mouse, twinkling stars will appear randomly in the center circle, increasing the overall fun and uncertainty.
